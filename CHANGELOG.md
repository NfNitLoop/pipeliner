Changelog
=========

v1.0.1 - January 29, 2020
-------------------------

 * Fix build error with newer versions of Rust.

v1.0.0 - November 18, 2018
--------------------------

 * Support for ordered mapping. Use `ordered_map()` if you need the order of
   your outputs to match the order of their inputs. This adds a performance
   penalty for the extra bookkeeping required. And you may see additional
   performance loss due to head-of-line blocking, depending on your workload(s).
 * Switched implementation to use crossbeam_channel, which greatly
   [improves performance][1].
 * Shrank the API. `map()` and `ordered_map()` return `impl Iterator`, so we
   no longer leak the internal `PipelineIter` type(s).
