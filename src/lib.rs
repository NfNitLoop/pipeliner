//! This crate provides a high-level framework for parallel processing.
//!
//! Main features:
//!
//!  * Accept input lazily from an Iterator.
//!  * Performs work in a user-specified number of threads.
//!  * Return all output via an Iterator.
//!  * Optionally buffer output.
//!  * `panic`s in your worker threads are propagated out of the output Iterator. (No silent
//!     loss of data.)
//!  * No `unsafe` code.
//!
//! Since `IntoIterator`s implement [Pipeline], you can, for example:
//!
//! ```
//! use pipeliner::Pipeline;
//! for result in (0..100).with_threads(10).map(|x| x + 1) {
//!     println!("result: {}", result);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! And, since the output is also an iterator, you can easily create a pipeline
//! with varying number of threads for each step of work:
//!
//! ```
//! use pipeliner::Pipeline;
//! // You might want a high number of threads for high-latency work:
//! let results = (0..100).with_threads(50).map(|x| {
//!     x + 1 // Let's pretend this is high latency. (ex: network access)
//! })
//! // But you might want lower thread usage for cpu-bound work:
//! .with_threads(4).out_buffer(100).map(|x| {
//!     x * x // ow my CPUs :p
//! });
//! for result in results {
//!     println!("result: {}", result);
//! }
//! ```
//!
